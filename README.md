# vim-purescriptConceal
Use vim's conceal feature to display unicode operators in Purescript without
changing the underlying file.

Best used with [creep](https://github.com/romeovs/creep) since many of the
conceal rules are taken from `creep.vim`.

## Installation

Decompress in your ~/vimfiles or ~/.vim, if you're using
pathogen (you should), put it in ~/.vim/bundle/haskellConceal
folder

For neovim, do the above but uniformly replace "vim" with "nvim".
